# Random forest for the eastern North American tree species

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/willvieira/TreesRandomForest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/willvieira/TreesRandomForest)

This is a repo to store some scripts and results about using random forest to explain the vital rates of eastern North American trees. It will also serve as a source of inspiration for my next projects to be more reproducible.
